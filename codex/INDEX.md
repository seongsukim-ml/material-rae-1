## Document List
1. `codex/MAINTENANCE_POLICY.md` - Governance principles and recurring review practices for the Codex folder
2. `codex/CHANGELOG.md` - Change history for operations rules and documentation
3. `codex/notion-paper-retrieval.md` - Default protocol for loading project papers from Notion with low-cost reasoning
4. `.agents/skills/notion-paper-retriever/SKILL.md` - Local project skill for Notion paper retrieval

## Usage Rules
1. If a Codex maintenance document is added, removed, or moved, update this index first.
2. For overlapping topics, prefer extending an existing document instead of creating a new file.
3. Freshness rule: documents with `last_updated` older than 30 days are flagged for monthly review.
